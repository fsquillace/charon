Last words
----------
Charon is the ferryman of Hades who carries souls of the newly deceased
across the rivers Styx and Acheron that divided the world of the living
from the world of the dead, in the same way the library *charon* defines
several implementation of data structures and link them between host and
device memory...

[verse, Dante Alighieri, from Divine Comedy]
